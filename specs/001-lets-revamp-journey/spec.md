# Feature Specification: Timeline Journey Profile View

**Feature Branch**: `001-lets-revamp-journey`  
**Created**: 2025-01-12  
**Status**: Ready for Planning  
**Input**: User description: "Revamp journey into UI to see all info in list view in separate page like profile page"

## Execution Flow (main)

```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí Extract: Create profile page with list-based journey view
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Actors: Users viewing their career journey
   ‚Üí Actions: Browse timeline nodes in organized list format
   ‚Üí Data: Existing timeline nodes (jobs, education, projects, etc.)
   ‚Üí Constraints: Simplify visualization for better usability
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí All clarifications resolved based on user feedback
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí Primary: User views career journey in organized profile format
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Separate current and past experiences
   ‚Üí Display hierarchical relationships as tree structure
   ‚Üí Include profile header with share functionality
6. Identify Key Entities
   ‚Üí Timeline nodes, hierarchical relationships, user profile
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí All requirements clarified and documented
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines

- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## User Scenarios & Testing _(mandatory)_

### Primary User Story

A user wants to view their career journey information in a clean, organized profile page format. They need to see their career nodes (jobs, education, projects, events, actions, career transitions) separated into current and past experiences, with hierarchical relationships displayed in a tree-like structure that's easy to browse and understand.

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Given** a user has timeline nodes with ongoing activities, **When** they view the profile page, **Then** they see current experiences (nodes without end dates) displayed in a separate section from past experiences
2. **Given** a user views the profile, **When** they look at the header, **Then** they see their profile name along with share and copy URL buttons
3. **Given** a user has hierarchical timeline nodes, **When** they browse the list, **Then** they see parent-child relationships displayed in a tree-like structure with proper indentation
4. **Given** a user clicks on a timeline node in the list, **When** the node is selected, **Then** a side panel opens showing detailed information about that node
5. **Given** a user clicks the share button, **When** on their profile page, **Then** they can share their profile with others
6. **Given** a user clicks the copy button, **When** on their profile page, **Then** the profile URL is copied to their clipboard

### Edge Cases

- What happens when a user has no current experiences (all nodes have end dates)?
- How does the system handle deeply nested hierarchical relationships in the tree view?
- What happens when a user has very large numbers of timeline nodes?
- How does the side panel behave on smaller screen sizes?

## Requirements _(mandatory)_

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST display timeline nodes separated into "Current Experiences" (nodes without end dates) and "Past Experiences" sections
- **FR-002**: System MUST show a profile header containing the user's profile name
- **FR-003**: Profile header MUST include a share button for sharing the profile
- **FR-004**: Profile header MUST include a copy button to copy the profile URL to clipboard
- **FR-005**: System MUST display all timeline node types (jobs, education, projects, events, actions, career transitions) in the appropriate section based on their end dates
- **FR-006**: System MUST display hierarchical parent-child relationships in a tree-like structure with visual indentation
- **FR-007**: System MUST maintain all existing node permissions and access controls in the profile view
- **FR-008**: Users MUST be able to click on any node to view its detailed information
- **FR-009**: System MUST display a side panel with node details when a node is selected
- **FR-010**: System MUST close the side panel when user deselects the node or selects a different node
- **FR-011**: System MUST NOT provide sorting or filtering options within the profile view
- **FR-012**: System MUST display all node metadata that was previously available in the timeline view

### Key Entities _(include if feature involves data)_

- **Timeline Node**: Career journey element with type, metadata, dates, hierarchical relationships, and permissions
- **Current Experience**: Timeline node without an end date, representing ongoing activities
- **Past Experience**: Timeline node with an end date, representing completed activities
- **Node Hierarchy**: Parent-child relationships displayed as a tree structure with indentation
- **Profile Header**: Section containing profile name and action buttons (share, copy URL)
- **Node Details Panel**: Side panel displaying comprehensive information about a selected node
