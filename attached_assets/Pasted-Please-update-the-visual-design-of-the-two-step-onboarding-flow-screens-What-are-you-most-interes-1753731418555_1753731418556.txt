Please update the visual design of the two-step onboarding flow (screens: “What are you most interested in?” and “Let's extract your professional data”) to match the design language of the rest of the app, including the newly updated sign-up/sign-in screen and the career journey visualization canvas.

✨ Visual Consistency Requirements:
1. Background and Container
Use the same deep purple gradient background with subtle glowing dots as seen in the career journey canvas.

Center the form within a semi-translucent container styled similarly to the sign-in box but larger in width (around 600–700px) to avoid wasted space.

Add a subtle drop shadow and rounded corners (radius: 1.5rem) for polish.

2. Typography
Use the same fonts and color styles as the rest of the app.

Ensure headings like "What are you most interested in?" and "Let's extract your professional data" have clear hierarchy with bold, gradient text (e.g. pink to purple like the “Welcome back” header).

Supporting text (e.g. descriptions) should be high-contrast and legible (avoid low-opacity greys).

3. Buttons
Replace the blue buttons (Continue, Extract Profile Data) with the gradient-styled buttons used in the sign-in screen (#a54eff → #ff306d or similar).

Button text should be white, bold, and centered.

4. Interactive Elements
For radio buttons (in Step 1), update the styling:

Circular outlines and selected states should reflect the gradient styling.

On hover, apply a soft glow or accent border.

For the LinkedIn input field (in Step 2):

Use a dark semi-transparent input background with white placeholder text.

Apply styling consistent with email/password fields in the sign-in screen.

5. Progress Indicator
Replace or restyle the step indicators to match the aesthetic (e.g., animated glowing dots or bars in purple/gradient tones).

Make the text (e.g. “Step 1 of 2”) clearly visible with high contrast.

6. Responsiveness
Ensure layout adjusts gracefully on small viewports:

Form container should reduce width on mobile, with stacked radio inputs.

Maintain consistent margins and vertical rhythm.
