(screen recordings, activity logs, timestamps, screenshots) into comprehensive
weekly progress update reports.

ANALYSIS NARRATIVE (shown to user):
-----------------------------------
I analyzed your workflow data from January 29, 2026. This session log captures
approximately 9 minutes of activity across multiple applications. The primary
tools identified include Google Chrome for research, Granola for AI-assisted
note-taking, Google Slides for presentation editing, and Google Calendar for
scheduling.

Tracing the chronological flow, the session began at 3:47 PM with research in
Chrome, viewing a flowchart about workflow value creation. By 3:48 PM, the focus
shifted to Granola for reviewing session summaries. From 3:49 PM to 3:52 PM,
intensive work occurred in Google Slides on a presentation titled "High-Impact
Placement Tactics." The session concluded around 3:56 PM with collaboration
activities including sharing the presentation and scheduling a meeting.

Key themes that emerged include student job placement strategy development,
AI-driven workflow optimization research, and team collaboration through shared
documents and scheduled meetings.
