## Overview

We need to add real-time collaboration to our platform so users can work together on documents.

---

## Goals

- Allow multiple users to edit documents at the same time
- Show who is currently viewing/editing
- Prevent conflicts when users edit the same content

---

## Requirements

### User Experience

Users should be able to see other people working on the same document. When someone makes changes, other users should see those changes quickly.

### Technical Needs

The system needs to handle multiple users editing documents. It should work reliably and not lose data.

### Performance

The system should be fast and responsive for users.

### Security

Only authorized users should be able to access and edit documents. We need to make sure data is protected.

## User Stories

**Story 1**: Users can collaborate on documents together

**Story 2**: Users can see who else is viewing the document

**Story 3**: Changes from other users appear automatically

## Acceptance Criteria

- Multiple users can edit the same document
- Changes are visible to other users
- No data loss when multiple people edit

## Technical Considerations

- Database needs to support concurrent updates
- Should consider using operational transform or CRDT
- Need proper authentication and authorization

---

## Success Metrics

- User adoption of collaboration features
- Number of concurrent users per document
