# PRD: React Client Architecture Refactor

## Executive Summary

This PRD outlines the comprehensive refactoring of the Lighthouse Journey Canvas React client to implement modern architecture patterns, improve maintainability, enhance testing capabilities, and establish scalable development practices. The project will transform the current type-based organization into a feature-based architecture following n-tier patterns and industry best practices.

## Problem Statement

### Current Pain Points

**Architecture Issues:**

- Components mix shared and feature-specific concerns, leading to tight coupling
- No clear separation between presentation, business logic, and data access layers
- Type-based directory structure makes feature development and maintenance difficult
- Limited dependency injection patterns make testing and mocking challenging

**Testing Challenges:**

- Test files scattered across multiple directories without clear organization
- Inconsistent mocking patterns and limited service layer testing
- No standardized testing utilities or shared test infrastructure
- Difficulty isolating features for independent testing

**Developer Experience Problems:**

- New developers struggle to understand code organization and contribution patterns
- Feature development requires touching multiple disparate directories
- Code reuse is limited due to tight coupling between components
- Build times and hot reload performance could be optimized

**Scalability Concerns:**

- Adding new features requires significant boilerplate and setup
- No enforced architectural boundaries between features
- Limited code splitting and bundle optimization
- State management not optimized for large-scale applications

## Goals & Success Metrics

## User Stories & Requirements

### Epic 1: Feature-Based Architecture

**As a developer, I want to work within self-contained feature modules so that I can develop and test features independently.**

**User Stories:**

- As a developer, I want each feature to have its own directory structure so that all related code is co-located
- As a developer, I want enforced boundaries between features so that I cannot accidentally create tight coupling
- As a developer, I want shared components to be clearly separated from feature-specific components
- As a developer, I want to be able to test a feature in isolation without setting up unrelated dependencies

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- Each feature has complete directory structure: `/api`, `/components`, `/hooks`, `/services`, `/stores`, `/types`, `/utils`, `/__tests__`
- ESLint rules prevent cross-feature imports (except through shared layer)
- Features can be developed and tested independently
- Clear documentation for feature creation and maintenance

### Epic 2: N-Tier Architecture Implementation

**As a developer, I want clear separation between presentation, business logic, and data access layers so that I can maintain and test each layer independently.**

**User Stories:**

- As a developer, I want UI components to only handle presentation logic
- As a developer, I want business logic to be centralized in service layers
- As a developer, I want data access to be handled by dedicated API and store layers
- As a developer, I want to mock any layer for testing purposes

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- Presentation layer contains only UI rendering and user interaction
- Business logic layer handles data transformation, validation, and business rules
- Data access layer manages API calls, caching, and state persistence
- Each layer can be mocked and tested independently
- Clear interfaces define contracts between layers

### Epic 3: Dependency Injection System

**As a developer, I want a dependency injection system so that I can easily test and mock dependencies.**

**User Stories:**

- As a developer, I want services to receive dependencies through injection rather than direct imports
- As a developer, I want to easily mock dependencies in tests

### Feature Module Structure

Each feature follows a consistent internal structure:

```typescript
features/[feature-name]/
├── api/                    # Feature-specific API calls
│   ├── [feature].api.ts
│   └── types.ts

│   ├── unit/
│   ├── integration/
│   └── e2e/
└── index.ts                # Feature public API
```

### Dependency Injection Configuration

```typescript
// shared/services/container.ts
export const TOKENS = {
  // Core services
  httpClient: token<HttpClient>('httpClient'),
  logger: token<Logger>('logger'),
  validator: token<Validator>('validator'),

  // Feature services
  timelineService: token<TimelineService>('timelineService'),
  authService: token<AuthService>('authService'),
  profileService: token<ProfileService>('profileService'),

  // API services
  timelineApi: token<TimelineApiService>('timelineApi'),
  authApi: token<AuthApiService>('authApi'),
  profileApi: token<ProfileApiService>('profileApi'),
};

// Service registration
container.bind(TOKENS.httpClient).toInstance(new HttpClient());
container.bind(TOKENS.logger).toInstance(new Logger());
container.bind(TOKENS.validator).toInstance(new Validator());

container
  .bind(TOKENS.timelineApi)
  .toInstance(
    ({ httpClient, logger }) => new TimelineApiService(httpClient, logger)
  );

container
  .bind(TOKENS.timelineService)
  .toInstance(
    ({ timelineApi, validator }) => new TimelineService(timelineApi, validator)
  );
```

### Testing Infrastructure

```typescript
// testing/utils/test-providers.tsx
export function TestProviders({
  children,
  container = createTestContainer(),
  initialState = {}
}: TestProvidersProps) {
  return (
    <ContainerProvider container={container}>
      <QueryClient client={createTestQueryClient()}>
        <BrowserRouter>
          <ThemeProvider>
            {children}
          </ThemeProvider>
        </BrowserRouter>
      </QueryClient>
    </ContainerProvider>
  );
}

// testing/utils/render-utils.tsx
export function renderWithProviders(
  ui: ReactElement,
  options: RenderOptions & {
    container?: Container;
    initialState?: Partial<AppState>;
  } = {}
) {
  const { container, initialState, ...renderOptions } = options;

  return render(ui, {
    wrapper: ({ children }) => (
      <TestProviders container={container} initialState={initialState}>
        {children}
      </TestProviders>
    ),
    ...renderOptions,
  });
}
```

### Performance Optimization Strategy

**Code Splitting Implementation:**

```typescript
// app/router/routes.tsx
const TimelineFeature = lazy(() =>
  import('../../features/timeline').then(module => ({
    default: module.TimelineFeature
  }))
);

const ProfileFeature = lazy(() => import('../../features/profile'));
const SharingFeature = lazy(() => import('../../features/sharing'));

export const routes = createBrowserRouter([
  {
    path: '/timeline',
    element: <FeatureWrapper><TimelineFeature /></FeatureWrapper>,
  },
  {
    path: '/profile',
    element: <FeatureWrapper><ProfileFeature /></FeatureWrapper>,
  },
  // Additional routes...
]);
```

**State Management Optimization:**

```typescript
// Normalized state structure for better performance
interface TimelineState {
  // Normalized entities
  nodes: Record<string, TimelineNode>;
  nodeIds: string[];

  // UI state
  selectedNodeId: string | null;
  expandedNodeIds: Set<string>;

  // Loading states
  loading: Record<string, boolean>;
  errors: Record<string, string | null>;
}
```
