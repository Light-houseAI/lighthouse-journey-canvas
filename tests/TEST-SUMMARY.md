## 🧪 Test Execution Guide

### **Quick Start**
```bash
# Run all timeline tests
npm run test:e2e

# Run consolidated test suite only  
npx playwright test tests/e2e/consolidated-timeline-tests.spec.ts

# Run with visual browser for debugging
npx playwright test tests/e2e/consolidated-timeline-tests.spec.ts --headed

# Generate detailed HTML report
npx playwright test tests/e2e/consolidated-timeline-tests.spec.ts --reporter=html
```

### **Development Workflow**
```bash
# Start mock server for testing
npm run dev:mock

# In separate terminal - run specific test
npx playwright test tests/e2e/consolidated-timeline-tests.spec.ts -g "Empty Timeline"

# For debugging - run single test with browser open  
npx playwright test tests/e2e/consolidated-timeline-tests.spec.ts -g "Node Selection" --headed --debug

## 🚨 Known Issues & Pending Actions

### **CRITICAL - Immediate Action Required**

1. **Server Validation Errors** 🚨
   ```
   Issue: "Validation failed: Unrecognized key(s) in object: 'start', 'end', 'context'"
   Impact: Child node creation fails on server
   Status: UI flow works, server schema needs investigation
   ```

2. **Individual Node Chevrons** ⚠️
   ```
   Issue: Per-node expand/collapse may not be fully functional
   Impact: Users can only use global expand/collapse
   Status: Needs testing and potential fix
   ```

### **IMPORTANT - Short Term**

3. **Enhanced Loading States** 📈
   ```
   Issue: Basic loading indicators during async operations
   Impact: Users don't see feedback during slow operations
   Status: Functional but could be improved
   ```

4. **Error Message UX** 💬
   ```
   Issue: Generic error messages for validation failures
   Impact: Users don't understand what went wrong
   Status: Shows errors but not user-friendly
   ```

### **NICE TO HAVE - Long Term**

5. **Keyboard Navigation** ⌨️
6. **Mobile Responsiveness** 📱
7. **Performance Optimization** ⚡
8. **Accessibility Enhancements** ♿
