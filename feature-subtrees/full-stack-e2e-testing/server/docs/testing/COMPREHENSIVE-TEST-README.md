└─────────────────────────┘
```

### 🎯 Node Type Coverage

All **6 PRD node types** are comprehensively tested:

- ✅ **Work Experience** - Employment history and roles
- ✅ **Education** - Academic qualifications and achievements  
- ✅ **Project** - Personal and professional projects
- ✅ **Event** - Conferences, meetups, presentations
- ✅ **Action** - Achievements, certifications, milestones
- ✅ **Career Transition** - Job changes, career pivots

## Test Files Structure

### Repository Layer Tests
```

├── base-repository.test.ts                # Core repository functionality
└── profile-repository.test.ts             # Profile aggregation
```

### Service Layer Tests
```
server/services/__tests__/
├── work-experience-service.test.ts        # Business logic & validation
├── education-service.test.ts              # Academic rules & skill extraction
└── base-service.test.ts                   # Core service functionality

### Controller Layer Tests
```
server/controllers/__tests__/
├── work-experience-controller.test.ts     # HTTP endpoints & responses
└── base-controller.test.ts                # Core controller functionality
```

### Integration Tests
```
server/tests/integration/
├── api-integration.test.ts                # Basic API functionality
├── enhanced-timeline-api.test.ts          # Advanced timeline features

```

## Test Execution

### 🚀 Quick Start

```bash
# Run all tests (recommended)
npm test

# Run parallel test execution with detailed reporting
node server/tests/run-parallel-tests.js

# Run specific test layers
npm test -- repositories
npm test -- services
npm test -- controllers
npm test -- integration
```

### 🔥 Parallel Execution

The parallel test runner optimizes execution time:

```bash
# Automated parallel execution with PRD validation
node server/tests/run-parallel-tests.js
```

**Execution Strategy:**
- Repository, Service, Controller tests run in parallel (isolated)
- Integration tests run sequentially (avoid conflicts)
- PRD validation runs last as final verification
