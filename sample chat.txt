Step 2: Frame the Goal & Capture "The What" (Journeys)
Lighthouse AI: "Perfect. Now, to make our future check-ins fast and effective, it helps to know what you're working on. What are the 1-3 main projects or initiatives you're focused on right now? You can think of these as your major 'Journeys'."
Alex: "Okay. I'm working on the new Team Dashboards feature, preparing the Q4 product roadmap, and also mentoring a new PM on the team."
Step 3: Add Context to Each Journey
Lighthouse AI: "Excellent. This gives us the 'buckets' to track your progress against. To make sure I understand them, could you give me a one-sentence goal for each?"
Lighthouse AI: "Let's start with 'Team Dashboards.' What's the main goal there?"
Alex: "To give team leads a single source of truth for their team's performance."
Lighthouse AI: "Got it. And for the 'Q4 product roadmap'?"
Alex: "To finalize and get buy-in on our strategic priorities for the next quarter."
The AI continues this for each Journey. This process is creating a structured knowledge base in the background.
Step 4: The Payoff and Next Steps
Lighthouse AI: "Thank you, Alex. I've got it all. Now I understand that you're a PM at Acme, focusing on Team Dashboards, the Q4 Roadmap, and mentorship, all with the goal of working towards a promotion.
When you tell me next week that you 'finally got the spec approved,' I'll know it was for the Dashboards feature and that it's a key step in that Journey.
I'm ready to start capturing your progress. I'll check in with you in a few days!"
