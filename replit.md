# LinkedIn Profile Extractor Application

## Overview

This is a full-stack TypeScript application that extracts LinkedIn profile data and allows users to review and selectively save profile information. The application features a React frontend with a Node.js/Express backend, using Drizzle ORM for database operations and modern UI components from shadcn/ui.

## User Preferences

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.

## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture
- **Framework**: React 18 with TypeScript
- **Routing**: Wouter for client-side routing
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with shadcn/ui component library
- **State Management**: React Hook Form for form handling, TanStack Query for server state
- **Build Tool**: Vite with hot module replacement and development plugins

### Backend Architecture
- **Runtime**: Node.js with Express.js framework
- **Language**: TypeScript with ES modules
- **API Style**: RESTful JSON APIs
- **Request Handling**: Express middleware for JSON parsing and logging
- **Error Handling**: Centralized error middleware with status code mapping

### Database & ORM

- **Migrations**: Drizzle Kit for schema migrations
- **Connection**: Uses Neon Database serverless PostgreSQL
- **Storage Abstraction**: Interface-based storage layer with in-memory fallback

## Key Components

### Data Extraction Service
- **LinkedIn Extractor**: Dual-mode extraction using ZenRows API and Playwright fallback
- **Profile Parsing**: Structured extraction of profile data including experiences, education, and skills
- **Error Handling**: Graceful fallback between extraction methods

### Profile Management

## Data Flow

1. **Profile Extraction**:
   - User enters LinkedIn username
   - System attempts ZenRows API extraction
   - Falls back to Playwright if ZenRows fails
   - Returns structured profile data

2. **Profile Review**:
   - Extracted data stored in SessionStorage
   - User navigates to review page
   - Selective checkbox interface for data fields
   - Real-time preview of selected data

3. **Profile Saving**:
   - Validated profile data sent to backend
   - Duplicate check performed
   - Data saved to PostgreSQL database
   - Success confirmation displayed

- **Simplified User Interface**: Removed user avatars to declutter the interface while preserving AI bot avatars for context
- **Visual Role Clarity**: Clear distinction between AI (left, purple, with avatar) and user (right, dark blue, no avatar) message styles
- **Defined Max-Width Layout**: Applied consistent max-w-[22rem] to all message bubbles with mx-2 margins to prevent edge-to-edge stretching
- **Enhanced Container Spacing**: Added horizontal margins to ensure visible space around all message bubbles for better visual hierarchy
- **Fixed Width Consistency**: Resolved AI messages appearing wider by adding `w-full` and `min-w-0` constraints to ensure identical visual width for both message types
- **Fully Transparent Chat Panel**: Removed all background styling from chat container to ensure journey visualization remains completely visible and unobstructed
