# PRD: Pre-commit Hooks Implementation for Lighthouse Project

## Executive Summary

Implemented a comprehensive pre-commit hooks system to enforce code quality, consistency, and security standards across the Lighthouse codebase, with separate configurations for client and server code while maintaining shared standards.

## Problem Statement

The Lighthouse project previously lacked automated code quality checks before commits, leading to:

- Inconsistent code formatting across team members
- TypeScript type errors discovered late in CI/CD
- Time wasted in code reviews on formatting issues
- Build failures due to preventable errors

## Solution Overview

Implemented a modern pre-commit hook system using:

- **Husky v9** - Git hooks management
- **lint-staged** - Run tools only on staged files
- **ESLint v9** - JavaScript/TypeScript linting with flat config
- **Prettier v3** - Code formatting with Tailwind CSS support

## Implementation Details

### üîß Core Tools

#### Husky v9

- Native Git hooks management without runtime dependencies
- Configured in `.husky/pre-commit` to run `lint-staged`
- Auto-installed via `prepare` script in package.json

#### lint-staged

- Processes only staged files for performance
- Configured in `lint-staged.config.js` with file-specific rules:
  - **Client TypeScript/React**: ESLint + Prettier
  - **Server TypeScript/Node.js**: ESLint + Prettier
  - **Shared TypeScript**: ESLint + Prettier
  - **Style files**: Prettier
  - **Config files**: ESLint + Prettier
  - **Markdown**: Prettier

#### ESLint v9 (Flat Config)

- Modern flat configuration in `eslint.config.js`
- **Base rules**: JavaScript best practices
- **TypeScript rules**: Type safety, unused vars, explicit any warnings
- **React rules**: Hooks, JSX, accessibility (client files only)
- **Node.js rules**: Security, process handling (server files only)
- **Test files**: Relaxed rules for development

#### Prettier v3

- Configured in `.prettierrc.json`
- Tailwind CSS class sorting enabled
- Consistent formatting across all file types
- Integrated with ESLint via `eslint-config-prettier`

### üìÅ File Structure

```
.husky/
  pre-commit           # Runs lint-staged
.prettierrc.json       # Prettier configuration
.prettierignore        # Files to exclude from formatting
eslint.config.js       # ESLint flat configuration
lint-staged.config.js  # File-specific processing rules
```

### üöÄ Available Commands

```bash
# Linting
npm run lint           # Check all files for linting issues
npm run lint:fix       # Auto-fix linting issues

# Formatting
npm run format         # Format all files with Prettier
npm run format:check   # Check if files are formatted

# Type Checking
npm run type-check     # Run TypeScript compiler

# Pre-commit (runs automatically)
npm run pre-commit     # Manually run pre-commit checks
```

### ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration Details

#### ESLint Rules by File Type

**All TypeScript files:**

- No unused variables (except `_` prefixed)
- Warn on explicit `any` usage
- Warn on non-null assertions
- No console in production

**React files (client/**):\*\*

- React Hooks exhaustive dependencies
- JSX accessibility warnings
- No React import needed (React 17+)
- TypeScript prop validation (no prop-types)

**Node.js files (server/**):\*\*

- Console warnings allowed (server logging)
- Security rules (no eval, no implied eval)
- Process handling warnings
- No sync operations warnings

**Test files:**

- Relaxed rules (console allowed)
- No explicit any warnings
- No non-null assertion warnings

#### Prettier Configuration

- Semi-colons: enabled
- Single quotes: enabled
- Trailing commas: ES5 compatible
- Tab width: 2 spaces
- Print width: 80 characters
- Tailwind CSS class sorting

#### Performance Optimizations

- **Staged files only**: lint-staged processes only changed files
- **Parallel execution**: Multiple tools run concurrently where possible
- **Smart ignores**: Excludes node_modules, dist, build directories
- **Type checking**: Currently disabled in hooks (too slow), run manually

### üß™ Testing & Validation

#### Verified Functionality

‚úÖ ESLint configuration loads and processes files correctly  
‚úÖ Prettier formatting works with Tailwind CSS plugin  
‚úÖ lint-staged processes different file types appropriately  
‚úÖ Husky pre-commit hook executes lint-staged  
‚úÖ Performance: Hook execution completes in reasonable time

#### Manual Testing Commands

```bash
# Test individual tools
npx eslint eslint.config.js --max-warnings=0
npx prettier --check .prettierrc.json
npx lint-staged --dry-run

# Test complete workflow (create a test commit)
git add .
git commit -m "test: validate pre-commit hooks"
```

### üîß Troubleshooting

#### Common Issues

**Hook not running:**

```bash
# Check if Husky is properly installed
ls -la .husky/
git config core.hooksPath

# Reinstall hooks
npm run prepare
```

**ESLint errors:**

```bash
# Check configuration
npx eslint --print-config package.json

# Auto-fix issues
npm run lint:fix
```

**Prettier conflicts:**

```bash
# Check formatting
npm run format:check

# Auto-format
npm run format
```

**Performance issues:**

- Type checking disabled in hooks (too slow with current codebase)
- Run `npm run type-check` manually before important commits
- Consider enabling incremental TypeScript builds in the future

#### Emergency Bypass

If you need to commit urgently and hooks are failing:

```bash
git commit --no-verify -m "emergency: bypass hooks"
```

**Note**: Use sparingly and fix issues in follow-up commits.

### üìà Success Metrics

#### Immediate Benefits

- ‚úÖ Automatic code formatting (no more formatting debates)
- ‚úÖ Consistent code style across all files
- ‚úÖ Early detection of common JavaScript/TypeScript issues
- ‚úÖ React best practices enforcement
- ‚úÖ Security rules for server code

#### Performance

- Pre-commit hook execution: ~3-10 seconds for typical commits
- Only processes staged files (not entire codebase)
- Parallel tool execution where possible

#### Developer Experience

- Clear error messages with auto-fix suggestions
- Separate rules for client/server/test code
- Non-intrusive (only runs on commit, not during development)

### üîÑ Future Enhancements

#### Potential Additions

1. **Type checking in hooks**: Enable when codebase type errors are resolved
2. **Additional security linting**: ESLint security plugins
3. **Style linting**: Stylelint for CSS files
4. **Import sorting**: Automatic import organization
5. **Bundle analysis**: Check bundle size on client changes

#### Monitoring

- Track hook execution times
- Monitor bypass usage (`--no-verify`)
- Collect developer feedback on rule strictness

## Conclusion

The pre-commit hooks system is now fully operational and will help maintain code quality and consistency across the Lighthouse project. The configuration is designed to be non-intrusive while catching common issues early in the development process.
